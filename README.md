# git-viewer# Git Viewer - Interactive Git Repository Browser

Git Viewer is a lightweight, extensible tool designed to provide an interactive, Bootstrap-powered web interface for exploring your Git repository. It automatically detects the current Git repository and allows you to view both commit and pull request informationâ€”both as lists and in detailed individual views.

## Features

- **Index Page**: A clean landing page that offers navigation to:
  - **Commits**: View a list of the last 20 commits. Click any commit to see detailed information and diffs.
  - **Pull Requests**: (Requires GitHub CLI) View a list of up to 20 pull requests. Click any PR to view its details.
- **Individual Views**:
  - **Commit Details**: Display commit metadata, author info, and full diff.
  - **Pull Request Details**: Show raw JSON details (fetched via the GitHub CLI) for a selected pull request.
- **Modern UI**: Built with [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) for a responsive and intuitive design.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular file structure for easy enhancements and future improvements.

## Prerequisites

- **Git**: The repository to be viewed must be a valid Git repository.
- **GitHub CLI (gh)**: Required for pull request functionality. [Install GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) if you want to view pull requests.
- **jq** (optional): Used for parsing JSON output from GitHub CLI. If not installed, PR details will be shown as raw JSON.
- **A web browser**: The tool automatically opens the generated HTML in your default browser.

## Installation

   - Place the entire `git-viewer` folder into the root of your Git repository.
2. **Set executable permissions**:
